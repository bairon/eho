# Eldritch Horror Online
Online webapp representation of the Eldritch Horror board game by Fantasy Flight Games.

# Intro
Primary goal of this project was to learn about and play around with different technologies. If we end up with an app that can allows people to play eldritch horror with people around the world then thats a solid plus.

Check it out on Heroku https://eldritch-horror-online.herokuapp.com/

# Building
The default gulp command will build the client app, run the node server, and watch for both client and server changes.
You can do pieces individually by invoking their corresponding gulp tasks (buildClient, runServer, watchClient, watchServer respectively). I have also set up a few VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) task configurations so that you can invoke them from the command palletet (control+p).
