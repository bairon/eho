Online webapp representation of the Eldritch Horror board game by Fantasy Flight Games.

# Building
The default gulp command will build the client app, run the node server, and watch for both client and server changes.
You can do pieces individually by invoking their corresponding gulp tasks (buildClient, runServer, watchClient, watchServer respectively). I have also set up a few VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) task configurations so that you can invoke them from the command palletet (control+p).
