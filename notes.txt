Dev strategy:
1. Create canvas with background image of game board
2. Model regions (tokyo, himalayas, etc) with x / y positions in canvas (scaling issues? how to guarantee coordinates?).
3. Model pieces, need to be able to render and have x / y position.
4. extract resources from vassal stuff somehow?
5. Need to be able to click and drag pieces. move x / y along with mouse move while in drag mode?
   Incrase image size and center over mouse while dragging.
